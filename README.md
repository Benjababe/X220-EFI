For my X220 on Mojave 10.14.6

In whatever case that my OS X Mojave installation gets fucked, reinstall using **Mojave Patcher 1.3.2** and Clover Configuration 5.4.5 (Other versions could be fine). It has been tested and working so don't stray from it me in the future.

Display scaling file will be placed as such: 
HDD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/DisplayVendorID-30e4/DisplayProductID-2d3
**The overrides folder may be hidden.**
